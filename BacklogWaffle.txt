1. Maze Generation
How to Demo: Start the game, click "New Game," and a maze-like map with paths should be generated.  
Notes: The maze should have a start and end point for enemies.

2. A* Pathfinding
How to Demo: Enemies should find their way from the start to the end using the shortest path available.  
Notes: Pathfinding algorithm (A*) implementation should be visible in enemy movement.

3. Tower Placement
How to Demo: Allow players to click on designated areas within the maze to place towers.  
Notes: Ensure that towers only go in valid positions and cannot overlap.

4. Enemy Waves
How to Demo: Enemies spawn and move through the maze following each round start.  
Notes: Demonstrate increasing difficulty and varied enemy types based on the "points" system.

5. Tower Attacks
How to Demo: Enemies that come into range of the towers should be shot at and get removed.  
Notes: Include basic attack animation (e.g., bullets).

6. Rounds
How to Demo: Defeat all enemies to progress to the next round. Earn money at the end of every round.
Notes: The reward should be the same as the difficulty of the round.

7. Upgrading Towers
How to Demo: Towers should be able to be upgraded to increase various attributes.  
Notes: The player should be able to click on towers to upgrade them, and changes should be visible.

8. Game Over Condition
How to Demo: If enemies reach the end, show a "Game Over" screen.  
Notes: Make sure this ends the game.
